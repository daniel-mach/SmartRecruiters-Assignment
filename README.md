FED Test build brief

SmartAttrax is pitching for a new client, Dissolve. The client has asked us to produce a working prototype of what their final site could look like and how it would work. Therefore your task is to build out the top half of their potential homepage so we can demo it to them in the pitch. As this is a new client pitch, attention to detail is critical.

They have raised a few key points with us which they would like to see demonstrated in the demo. As their company is about promoting equality in the workplace accessibility is high on the list so we would like to see you include some basic accessibility best practices into the build. They have seen from analytics that their current site is mostly accessed via mobile devices. It is essential that this is built with a mobile first approach. Because of this performance is also important so it would be good to see some consideration given to this area.

We would like this completed without the use of a JS framework (React, Vue ect) or a CSS framework (Tailwind ect). However we would like to see this built using SASS/SCSS, ideally using BEM.

Functionality:

- As this is mobile first we would like to see it respond through screen sizes in a clean and smooth manner.
- For the mobile navigation when you press the burger menu the navigation should slide out from the right side of the screen and slide back to the right when it is closed.
- When you click on the button that reads ‘Click here to register your interest’ a simple modal will open (design is provided). The user should be able to enter their name and the {name placeholder} should update with the text they enter. When the close button is clicked the modal should close, returning the user back to the homepage.
- As this is a pitch for new business we could only get bonus points if you want to use some creativity to create any transitions or animations on the elements.
